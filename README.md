# Miniproject

This piece of code is for the robot programming exam.
There are many possible improvements.
One of these could be having the program split into several documents to give a better overview of the code. 
However, this is easy to say in retrospect (sorry Carlos)

Additionally, it is clear that we did not understand how to use GitHub, and, as such, it is only relevant to look in the main branch, since all other branches are cluttered with non-important and unused files.
As a result of this, however, we believe that we have learned about programming to a higher extent than expected.
